    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",

    "## Question 1\n",

    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",

    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "An SQL databse is relational whereas NoSQL is non relationship or distributed database. SQL is presented in tables where as NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores SQL relies on horse power of hardware and NoSQL relies on servers. SQL has predefined scheme; noSQL does not. SQL uses Structured Query Langauge and NoSQL relies on Unstructured Query Language. SQL is not best for storing hierarchal data whereas oSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data._______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
